# WebSocket to Telnet Proxy

This project provides a WebSocket to Telnet proxy, allowing WebSocket clients to connect to a Telnet server. The WebSocket server listens on port 80 and forwards all messages to a Telnet server running on `connect.astralen.quest` at port 3000.

## Features

- WebSocket server listening on port 80
- Forwards WebSocket messages to Telnet server
- Supports both UTF-8 and binary messages
- Handles connection errors gracefully

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Clone this repository or copy the code into a new project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

## Usage

To start the server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the WebSocket server listening on port 80. When a WebSocket connection is established, the server will create a connection to the Telnet server at `connect.astralen.quest` on port 3000.
